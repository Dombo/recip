## Bread Bible

Several variations of this will exist over time. Possible variations I'm working on/hoping to, brioche, milk loaf, olive/chilli mix in bread.

### Wholemeal no-knead

#### Ingredients

Ingredient | Measurement, Weight | Notes
---|---|----
Wholemeal Flour | 240 grams | 
All Purpose Flour | 250 grams | Prefer Bread Flour 
Packet Yeast | 7 grams |  
Salt | 7 grams |
Water | 475 ml | Room Temperature

#### Method

*DOUGH PREP:*
In a large mixing bowl, whisk the flour, salt, and yeast together until mixed. Stir in the water until a chunky, thick dough forms.
Cover with something so that too much moisture cannot escape (waxed paper, plastic, tea towel will do).
Let sit for 12-24 hours in a room temperature location.

*PREP FOR BAKING:*
When youâ€™re ready to bake, preheat the oven to 240 celcius. 
Stick a large pot/dutch oven (or similar) in the oven for the duration of heating. 
At this point, the dough should be big and puffy and pretty loose, with little bubbles in it. 
Gently scrape the dough out onto a well-floured surface. (Remember: *NO KNEAD.*) 
Gently shape it into a ball with flour on the outside, set on a piece of parchment.

*BAKE:* 
Lift the dough and parchment together into the pan so the parchment lines the bottom of the hot pan.
Bake, covered, for 30 minutes. 
Remove the cover and bake another 10-15 minutes to get the exterior nice and golden brown and crispy.
