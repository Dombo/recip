# Sauces and Vinaigrettes (various recipes)

## Generic Method

For all of these quick sauces you may follow the same method.

In a suitable sized container with a fluid tight lid, combine the ingredients and shake them until an emulsion is formed.

Taste to confirm deliciousness and make any adjustments you deem neceessary.

If you're doing a bigger batch reach for the blender/food processor. Most of these will keep in the fridge for some time. Throw them in a sauce bottle for easy portioning.

### Honey Mustard

Goes nicely over roast vegetables, a salad that could use a sweet note, can dip things in it, if you leave it on the thicker side you can smear it on a sandwich.

Nut butter | 1 tbsp | sub tahini, peanut/almond butter but cashew butter yields the most neutral flavour with a slight sweet inflection that plays nicely

### Yoghurt Garlic "Ranch" Sauce

Dairy rich garlicy goodness. 

A variation of this recipe could be called ranch, it just calls for a bunch of powdered spices and the use of mayonaise, sour cream and buttermilk. having tried the 'traditional' recipe, I perceive minimal difference for the effort and additional ingredients. Try my take.  

Goes well over roasted meals or as an aside dipping sauce for spiced food. It's pretty versatile for my tastes.

"In 2017, 40% of Americans named ranch as their favorite dressing, according to a study by the Association for Dressings and Sauces."

What kind of country has an association for dressings and sauces.

Garlic, finely diced | 1 clove | More to taste, can also grate it if you have a microplane or smush it to a paste with the flat of your knife and some salt
