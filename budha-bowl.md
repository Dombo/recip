## Method

Preheat the oven to 180c

GRAIN:: Start cooking the rice by absorpotion: rice into pot, cover with water/stock (waterline 1-2 cm above the rice) - drop in the stock cube if using water/reconstituting stock. Heat on high to bring to a simmer. The method is pretty simple and I'm not pedantic about rice cooking, you can pull the pot and drain it whenever you're ready to use it. Drain through the pot lid to save on washing up.

ROOT VEGETABLES:: Dice the sweet potatoes, once the oven has come up to temp place them inside on a baking tray/dish. Line with baking paper/foil to prevent sticking, *alternatively* toss them lightly in oil beforehand to the same effect. This is also pretty forgiving, 20-30 minutes tops.

PROTEIN:: 1-2 tbsp oil into a wide pan, medium heat to start. Cut the tofu to desired size, shape is not important but they should be equal in size and manageably. Cubes or strips works for me usually. In a plastic container throw some salt, pepper and 2 tbsp corn flour (more as needed). One by one, toss the tofu until coated and rest on a plate. Place all tofu pieces in the pan, turning on each side after appropriate level of "doneness" has been achieved. They should crisp up nicely but retain a soft texture internally. Pull the tofu pieces from the pan onto the plates/bowls and drop the heat to low.

GREENS:: Using the now empty but still warm pan from the tofu, throw the kale or any other hardy green in there and stir around to wilt. If your other ingredients are looking a bit dry throw some water in the pan to keep it moist.

SAUCE:: Combine the tahini, soy sauce in a small container with a lid. Shake agressively to combine, add water and shake until desired consistency achieved.

To plate, you can mix all the ingredients or keep them seperate. I put them in a bowl, allocating 1 third of the bowl to grain, root vegetables & greens. I top with tofu and pour the sauce over the root vegetables.
