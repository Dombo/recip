## Method

Preheat the oven to 150c.

DRY INGREDIENTS:: Mix the oats, nuts and seeds together in a bowl.

WET INGREDIENTS:: Place the oil and sweeteners in a pan on mid-low heat. Once dissolved and homogenous pour overtop your dry ingredients, mix thoroughly to combine.

BAKE DRY:: Spread out onto a baking tray, lined with parchment paper optionally for easy cleanup. Bake for 20 minutes. Pull out and add your coconut flakes if you're using them, mix through ensuring to roll over some of the oats for even browning. Rotate the try and place back in for another 5-10 minutes - if using the coconut flakes keep an eye on it as they burn easily.

Pull out and let cool for 10 minutes before storing in a jar.
