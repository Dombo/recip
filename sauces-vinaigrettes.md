### Yoghurt Garlic "Ranch" Sauce

Dairy rich garlicy goodness. 

A variation of this recipe could be called ranch, it just calls for a bunch of powdered spices and the use of mayonaise, sour cream and buttermilk. having tried the 'traditional' recipe, I perceive minimal difference for the effort and additional ingredients. Try my take.  

Goes well over roasted meals or as an aside dipping sauce for spiced food. It's pretty versatile for my tastes.

"In 2017, 40% of Americans named ranch as their favorite dressing, according to a study by the Association for Dressings and Sauces."

What kind of country has an association for dressings and sauces.
